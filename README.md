# React Native FlatList Blank Screen Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component renders a blank screen even after successfully fetching data from an API. The data is fetched correctly, as confirmed by console logs, but the FlatList remains empty.

## Problem

The `MyComponent` fetches data from a public API and updates its state. The `isLoading` state is correctly set to `false` once the data is fetched, indicating the API call completes successfully. However, the FlatList does not render the received data.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the FlatList component is only rendered when data is available and `isLoading` is false.  This is achieved by incorporating a conditional check on the `data` array and the `isLoading` state.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run the app on a simulator or device using `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the blank screen displayed by the app despite a successful API call.
